### Hi, I'm Jack 👋

<!--
**M3353/M3353** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a student currently studying Computing and the Arts at Yale University. I am interested in the intersection of Art and Computer Science, ranging from game development to UI/UX development. 

## You can find me around the web: 
- Sharing artworks and doodles on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/artjackli) 🎨
- Exploring different projects on my website (coming soon) 🔒
- or just email me at jack.li@yale.edu
